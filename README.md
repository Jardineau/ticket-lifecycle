So for this example we will use Karen to make a ticket we will make it a buisness outage making it a High impacting SLA.

</p>
<p>
Once the ticket is created, we will log in as John Doe, who has limited access and serves as the first responder. The ticket in our default settings does not assign a team to this John will assign the ticket to the Level II Support team to address the issue and also elevated it to the System admin department and that stops John from having access to the ticket.

<p>
Now, let us log in as Jane Doe, who has Supreme Admin access and can view all details. She will elevate the SLA Plan and set the priority to the highest level to match the severity of the ticket. After simulating the resolution of the issue, she will close the ticket.</p>

<p>
This is a simple scenario, but it provides an idea of how an end user submits a ticket and how the help desk team views it, determines the best course of action based on the ticket's severity, assigns it to the appropriate team, and communicates with the end user. Help desk professionals handle tickets daily and may process more than 100 tickets per day, depending on the company. Hopefully, this paints a clear picture of the lifecycle of a help desk ticket.
